# Churn Prediction With Sparkify
Predicting churn on music streaming with Sparkify

---

## Overview
In this project, I worked on manipulating a large dataset with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. I used the Spark MLlib to build a classification model to predict churn.

Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.

The project covered:
Loading large datasets into Spark and manipulate them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes.
Using the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models
