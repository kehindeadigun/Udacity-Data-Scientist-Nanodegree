# Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline
I applied my data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize real messages that were sent during disaster events so that the messages could be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
